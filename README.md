# rust_quantum_mathematics

This is a rust program I made while learning quantum mathematics. I first learnt quantum mathematics on 1 December 2022 and as of this writing, today is 2 December 2022.
I made this project because I want to learn programming, especially programming with rust and also because I want to learn quantum mathematics and hopefully by programming what I have learnt, I can remember what I learnt better.


Anyway in case you want to try to use this program , first you have to have Cargo from Rust. Then after that you should do this (in linux, I dont know how it works in WIndows) :
1. git clone https://github.com/RXRDRIRI/rust_quantum_mathematics/ 
2. cd ./rust_quantum_mathematics/
3. cargo build && cargo run

Functionality that I have implemented : 
- Calculating the q integer using q variable and a base integer
- some error handling
- calculating q factorial and calcualting q binomial

Functionality that I want to implement : 
- Calculating q derivative
- Better error handling
- Making sure q variable is a positive real number and n is a positive non zero natural number
